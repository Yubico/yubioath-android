Android application for TOTP with YubiKey NEO
=============================================

See the file COPYING for copyright and license information.

Introduction
------------

This is a small android application for doing Oath TOTP codes with
the help of a YubiKey NEO.
To use it when you have a TOTP qr-code:

1. Make sure NFC is turned on
2. Start the application
3. Select 'Program NEO'
4. The barcode scanner will start if installed, otherwise offer to install
5. Scan the barcode and select which slot to program
6. Swipe the YubiKey NEO as instructed
7. Select 'TOTP from Slot x' and the Slot you programmed
8. Swipe the YubiKey NEO as instructed
9. Enter the code shown on screen

The programming feature is equivalent to running ykpersonalize with the
correct slot:
-----------
  $ ykpersonalize -[1/2] -ochal-resp -ochal-hmac -ohmac-lt64 \
    -oserial-api-visible -oallow-update
-----------

Building
--------

This project uses maven3 for building, so to build:
-----------

-----------
After building the .apk file can be found in the target directory.
